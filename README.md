**QUICK INTRO:** A number of studies have used various machine learning (ML) techniques to forecast the demand (load) and supply (power production) of microgrid power in rural areas, using weather data as inputs; however, there are many practical problems with this data. This includes exorbitant procurement costs and a dearth of communication-failure backups with weather data services. The current literature has not yet addressed these pragmatic concerns. These problems also make the implementation of microgrids and the widespread deployment of solar power more challenging, especially in rural areas with low-income levels.

**OUR SOLUTION:** As a more practical alternative to weather-based models, this study suggests models that instead use historical data of power demand and supply.

**APPROACH:** We employ ML techniques using historical data to forecast demand and supply over five different time horizons: 15 minutes, 1-hour, 1-day, 1-week, and 1-month.

**BEST MODELS:** Demand-side and supply-side forecasting performs best using the Linear Regression model, which also had the best Pearson Correlation Coefficient, Mean Absolute Error and Root Mean Squared Error—comparable to state-of-the-art weather-based models.

**PROJECT IMPLICATIONS:** Our models are a cheaper and safer option—enabling wider deployment of microgrids and solar power in rural areas, especially where high costs are an issue.
